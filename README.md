## Web Scrapin Task

It may be hard problem to solve - requires advanced use of selenium.

For this assignment: Go to [https://food.grab.com/sg/en/](https://food.grab.com/sg/en/) and enter any place in Singapore. The website will display a number of restaurants around the given location.

Scroll down and click "Load More" when you see one. There, you would need to click many such "Load More" buttons if you want to see all the restaurants

For this assignment, you have to fetch and give the latitudes and longitudes of all the restaurants on this page

Grab is the Swiggy of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines etc. To access it on your browser, you would have to use a VPN or a proxy. Hope that helps. As you will notice, latitudes and longitudes are not available on the page -- but there is a way to get them from the **same page** - without using any third-party service such as maps opening each restaurant separately etc. The assignment is to find a way to get the data from the same page and code it. 

Do not use any python maps libraries like Geopy, Geopandas etc. or even Google Maps, Open Maps etc. The data is directly given from Grab. You have to find it and then, write a code to scrape it. 

Do note that we need the latitudes and latitudes of ALL restaurants for all of Singapore - which should be more than a hundred on one page (in a city like Manila, Philippines).

## Submission

Submit your code with proper comments. Add it to a Github repository and submit the link.

Also submit the data that you scraped using their script and report the total number of restaurants that you got.
